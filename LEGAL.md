###LOTS – LEGAL DISCLAIMER 
Effective Date: July 2025 
Version: 3.1 
Jurisdiction-Neutral Statement 
###1. Nature of LOTS 
LOTS is a decentralized wellness platform offering remote Reiki sessions as a form of spiritual and energetic 
well-being. The primary purpose of LOTS is to provide clients with personalized  energy alignment services performed 
remotely by certified practitioners. 
Additionally, every Reiki session purchased grants clients automatic, free complimentary participation in LOTS 
blockchain-recorded energy cycle. This cycle symbolizes the energetic flow initiated by each session. 
At the conclusion of each cycle, certain participants may be randomly selected via blockchain smart contract logic 
(Chainlink VRF) to receive USDT distributions. These distributions represent a symbolic energy return mechanism, 
not a reward, prize, or financial product. 
LOTS does not operate as a lottery, gambling service, investment platform, or financial advisor. 
###2. No Custody – Automated Energy Redistribution 
Payments for Reiki sessions are processed directly via self-custodied blockchain wallets. 
LOTS does not custody client funds, nor manually manage balances. 
Any USDT distributions associated with the energy cycle are processed automatically via immutable smart contract 
logic. 
There is no manual override, human intervention, or discretionary control over the distribution process. 
Distributions serve as an automated form of energetic redistribution, reflecting the symbolic return of abundance 
within the cycle. They do not constitute rewards, promises, or guaranteed returns. 
###3. Geographic and Legal Considerations 
● Reiki services are available globally, subject to local regulations regarding spiritual services. 
● Participation in the blockchain-based cycle is restricted to individuals aged 18 years or older, or the age of 
majority in their jurisdiction. 
● LOTS reserves the right to restrict access from jurisdictions under international sanctions or where 
blockchain-based interactions are prohibited. 
You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with your local regulations. 
###4. User Responsibility and Acceptance of Risk 
By interacting with LOTS, you confirm that: 
● You are of legal age to participate in the blockchain component. 
● You understand that USDT distributions, if received, are the outcome of automated smart contract 
processes, without human discretion. 
● You acknowledge that Reiki services are spiritual in nature, and LOTS makes no medical claims or financial 
promises. 
● You assume full responsibility for your actions and wallet interactions. 
● You are responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes related to digital assets received. 
###5. Public Blockchain Transparency 
Transactions and wallet addresses involved in LOTS energy cycle are publicly visible on blockchain explorers. 
This is inherent to blockchain technology and does not constitute personal identification under data protection 
regulations. 
LOTS itself does not collect, store, or associate personal data. 
###6. Limitation of Liability 
LOTS, its developers, practitioners, infrastructure providers, and contributors: 
● Make no guarantees regarding outcomes of Reiki sessions or distributions. 
● Disclaim all liability for loss, damage, or claims arising from participation. 
● Are not responsible for individual results, tax compliance, or regulatory obligations in your jurisdiction. 
Participation in both Reiki services and the blockchain energy cycle is at your sole risk. 
###7. Governance and Protocol Autonomy 
LOTS is governed entirely by decentralized smart contracts. No human entity exercises control over distributions, 
selections, or outcomes. 
Future community coordination may assist in non-critical protocol decisions without modifying the automated 
processes. 
###8. Acceptance Clause 
By interacting with LOTS, making a Reiki session purchase, or connecting your wallet to participate in the energy cycle: 
● You agree to this Legal Disclaimer and all associated policies. 
● You acknowledge your voluntary participation and waive any claims of liability or compensation. 
● You accept that your participation is governed by immutable code and not by human guarantees. 
If you do not accept these terms, you must discontinue interaction immediately. 

###LOTS – Spiritual Wellness First. Energy Redistributed. Blockchain Governed. 
Autonomous by Code.
