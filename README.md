🌐 What is LOTS?
LOTS is a decentralized wellness protocol on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). It merges remote Reiki sessions with blockchain-powered symbolic energy blessings. After booking a Reiki session, each participant is automatically and freely connected to the universal blessing cycle. Blessings (delivered as USDT via smart contracts) are distributed transparently as symbolic energy gifts — not as financial promises.

LOTS does not constitute gambling, lottery, investment, or any speculative financial activity.
