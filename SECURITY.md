## Responsible Disclosure

LOTS is a decentralized, immutable smart contract protocol. However, we welcome reports from ethical hackers and security researchers to help ensure the safety and integrity of the ecosystem.

If you discover any potential vulnerabilities affecting:

- The frontend or backend infrastructure
- Smart contract logic
- Signature or nonce validation
- Interaction flows or APIs

Please report them responsibly to: **lotsmlinv@proton.me**
